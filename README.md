# svg to webm recorder

Created largely from [this excellent example](http://mozdevs.github.io/MediaRecorder-examples/record-canvas-to-video.html)

Replace the image and change the `recorder.stop()` timeout in the code to record your SVG playback.

## usage

open the HTML file in chrome [FF doesn't work :(], wait a couple of seconds, then the video will be done and you can right click to download
